This Project investigation combines exclusive Facebook data (Condor Dataset, Crowdtangle, Ad’s) and public information to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the Social Media behavior to determine if there is coordinated non-authentic behavior. We use
TeleSUR’s English language media operations and its partners as a case of study.

This project in founded by the Social Media and Democracy Research Grants from the Social Science Research Council and access to Facebook data via Social Science One.

The Social Media and Democracy Research Grants support research that examines the impact of social media and related digital technologies on democracy and elections.
