This Research Project combines [exclusive Facebook data ](https://socialscience.one/blog/unprecedented-facebook-urls-dataset-now-available-research-through-social-science-one)(Condor Dataset, [Crowdtangle](https://www.crowdtangle.com/), [Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api)) and public data to quantitatively (Coordinated link sharing behaviour analysis) and qualitatively (Content Analysis) analyze the Social Media behavior to determine if there is [coordinated inauthentic behavior](https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/). We use TeleSURâ€™s English language media operations and its partners as a study case.
